# succubus-race

Hello my fellow yees and haws!

My name is Nerd Fairchild. I'm a very new to this whole coding thing but I'm trying. Also English is my second language so please let me know if you find any grammar mistakes I made so I can fix them.
I made this Succubus/Incubus race to Dungeons & Dragons 5e because I thought it would be cool. Not every idea in this race is my own. I was highly inspired by TheRedstom's Succubus/Incubus race for 5e. You can find TheRedstom's version of this race here:

The two versions have a lot of things in common but there are a bunch of changes in my version which makes the background more useful and enjoyable for me.

I hope you'll like it and please let me know if you find any bugs or something else, so I can fix it.
